CPROVER is a framework of software analysis tools. See https://www.cprover.org/
for further information about the tools, publications, and the pointers to
source code.

This archive contains the following files:

- goto-cc: this C compiler transforms input files into so-called
  "goto-binaries," which are encoded in CBMC's intermediate representation.

- cbmc-binary: this is the actual verification tool. It takes a goto-binary or
  source code as input and checks the properties specified by command-line
  flags.

- cbmc: this wrapper script invokes cbmc-binary and goto-cc, parsing the
  property file to pass the correct flags to cbmc-binary and returning the
  correct return codes for SV-COMP.

The binaries were compiled on Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS; the binaries
should be self-hosting on similar operating systems.  The upstream URL, if
you wish to compile it yourself, is https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc

To use the tool, run the tool passing a source file as argument. For C source
code, and as only installation requirement, make sure a C compiler (such as GCC)
is installed.

For SV-COMP, use the wrapper script provided in this distribution, which takes
the following options:
  <path(s)> to sources
  --32 or --64: set the bit width
  --propertyfile <file>: read SV-COMP property specification from <file>
  --graphml-witness <file>: write SV-COMP witness to <file>
